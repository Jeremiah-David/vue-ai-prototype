# AI Alpha Prototype - Development Task List

**MAJOR PIVOT: Event Creation Tool Implementation**
**Current Status: Ready to implement Event Creation Tool pivot**

## üîÑ CURRENT TASKS (Phase 5: Event Creation Tool Pivot)

### ‚úÖ 5.1 Event Creation Tool Implementation (COMPLETED)
**NEW DIRECTION**: Transform from story creation tool to event creation tool

#### Required AI Methods (Only these 4 methods are available to AI):
- [x] **setEventName(name)** - Set the event name
- [x] **setEventDescription(description)** - Set event description  
- [x] **setTicketName(name)** - Set ticket name (default: "General Admission")
- [x] **toggleWaitlist(enabled)** - Toggle waitlist on/off (default: off)

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [x] **Update AI Manipulation Registry** (`src/services/aiManipulationRegistry.js`)
  - [x] Remove all story-related methods (addStoryElement, story themes, etc.)
  - [x] Remove UI element methods (addButton, addCard, addCounter, addImage, etc.)
  - [x] Add the 4 event creation methods listed above
  - [x] Update validation and security boundaries

- [x] **Update Home.vue Component**
  - [x] Replace story elements display with event creation interface
  - [x] Add event name display section
  - [x] Add event description display section
  - [x] Add ticket information display
  - [x] Add waitlist status indicator (radio button: on/off)
  - [x] Update demo examples to be event-focused
  - [x] Remove story-related UI elements and styling helpers

- [x] **Update AI Service** (`src/services/aiService.js`)
  - [x] Modify function schemas to only include 4 event methods
  - [x] Update AI prompts to focus on event creation
  - [x] Remove story-related AI instructions
  - [x] Add event creation context and examples

### ‚úÖ 5.2 Testing Event Creation Tool (READY FOR TESTING)
- [ ] Test "Create a tech conference event" command
- [ ] Test "Make a music festival with VIP tickets" command  
- [ ] Test waitlist toggle functionality
- [ ] Verify default ticket name is "General Admission"
- [ ] Test event description updates
- [ ] Verify only 4 methods are available to AI

**NEXT STEPS**: Test the following commands in the browser:
1. "Create a tech conference in San Francisco"
2. "Make a music festival with VIP tickets and waitlist enabled"
3. "Set up a corporate training event"
4. "Create a workshop with student tickets"

## COMPLETED PHASES

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core UI Infrastructure (Frontend Implementation)
- [x] Interactive demo interface with AI commands
- [x] UI manipulation methods (buttons, cards, counters)
- [x] Dynamic element management and theming
- [x] Visual enhancements and animations

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Mock AI Integration
- [x] Command parsing and intent recognition
- [x] Story generation system
- [x] Context management and history
- [x] Predefined demo scenarios

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Real AI Integration
- [x] OpenAI API integration with function calling
- [x] Secure API key management
- [x] Advanced error handling and fallbacks
- [x] Enterprise-ready architecture

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: AI Manipulation Registry (Security Implementation)
- [x] Created centralized AI manipulation registry (`src/services/aiManipulationRegistry.js`)
- [x] Implemented security boundaries and validation
- [x] Added comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- [x] Built audit logging system for all AI actions
- [x] Updated AI service to use registry exclusively
- [x] Refactored Home.vue component to use registry
- [x] Enforced security model - AI can only execute registry methods
- [x] Added error handling and proper boundaries
- [x] **STORY CREATION TOOL COMPLETE** - Fully functional with 10+ AI methods

### üìã Phase 5: Direction Change Documentation
- [x] **PIVOT DECISION**: Change from story creation tool to event creation tool
- [x] **REQUIREMENTS DEFINED**: 4 specific event methods only
- [x] **TASK LIST UPDATED**: Clear implementation roadmap created
- [x] **ARCHITECTURE PRESERVED**: Registry security model will be maintained

### ‚ùå DOCUMENTATION (DO LAST - AFTER EVENT TOOL COMPLETE)
- [ ] Update README.md with event creation focus
- [ ] Create user guide for event creation commands
- [ ] Document security model and boundaries
- [ ] Update API documentation for event methods
- [ ] Create developer guide for extending registry

## ARCHITECTURE NOTES

### Current State
- **Story Creation Tool**: Fully functional with 10+ AI manipulation methods
- **Security Registry**: Complete and working
- **AI Integration**: Full OpenAI API integration with function calling

### New Direction: Event Creation Tool
- **Scope Reduction**: From 10+ methods to exactly 4 event methods
- **UI Focus**: Event name, description, ticket info, waitlist toggle
- **Same Architecture**: Registry security model preserved
- **Same Technology**: Vue 3, OpenAI API, enterprise security

### Security Model (Preserved)
```
User Command ‚Üí AI Service ‚Üí Registry Validation ‚Üí Secure Execution ‚Üí UI Update
```

### Key Files to Modify
- `src/services/aiManipulationRegistry.js` - Replace methods with event methods
- `src/services/aiService.js` - Update function schemas for event methods
- `src/components/Home.vue` - Replace story UI with event creation UI

### New Event Creation Commands (Target)
- "Create a tech conference in San Francisco"
- "Make a music festival with VIP tickets and waitlist enabled"
- "Set up a corporate training event"

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT IMPLEMENTATION SESSION
1. **Implement the 4 event methods** in the registry first
2. **Update the UI** to display event information instead of stories  
3. **Update AI service** with new function schemas
4. **Test the event creation** functionality
5. **Document after everything works**

**STATUS**: Ready to begin Phase 5 implementation in next session.
