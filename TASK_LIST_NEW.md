# AI Alpha Prototype - Development Task List

**Current Status: AI Manipulation Registry Implementation Complete**
**Next Priority: Testing and Validation**

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### ‚úÖ Phase 3.5: AI Manipulation Registry (COMPLETED)
- [x] Created centralized AI manipulation registry (`src/services/aiManipulationRegistry.js`)
- [x] Implemented security boundaries and validation
- [x] Added comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- [x] Built audit logging system for all AI actions
- [x] Updated AI service to use registry exclusively
- [x] Refactored Home.vue component to use registry
- [x] Enforced security model - AI can only execute registry methods
- [x] Added error handling and proper boundaries

### üîÑ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Phase 4: Validation)

#### 4.1 Testing and Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Test registry implementation in development mode**
- [ ] **Validate all AI commands work through registry**
- [ ] **Test mock AI mode functionality**
- [ ] **Verify security boundaries prevent unauthorized access**
- [ ] **Test error handling and validation**
- [ ] **Confirm action logging works correctly**
- [ ] **Test all theme and color constants**
- [ ] **Validate story element creation through registry**

#### 4.2 Bug Fixes and Refinements
- [ ] Fix any runtime errors discovered during testing
- [ ] Ensure template renders correctly with new registry structure
- [ ] Validate that all demo scenarios still work
- [ ] Test incremental counter functionality
- [ ] Ensure background/theme changes work properly

#### 4.3 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with real OpenAI API (if configured)
- [ ] Validate function schema matches registry methods
- [ ] Test conversation history and context management
- [ ] Verify cost controls and session limits work
- [ ] Test fallback to mock mode

### ‚ùå DOCUMENTATION (DO LAST - AFTER TESTING)
- [ ] Update README.md with new architecture
- [ ] Create user guide for registry-based commands
- [ ] Document security model and boundaries
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create developer guide for extending registry

## COMPLETED PHASES

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core UI Infrastructure (Frontend Implementation)
- [x] Interactive demo interface with AI commands
- [x] UI manipulation methods (buttons, cards, counters)
- [x] Dynamic element management and theming
- [x] Visual enhancements and animations

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Mock AI Integration
- [x] Command parsing and intent recognition
- [x] Story generation system
- [x] Context management and history
- [x] Predefined demo scenarios

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Real AI Integration
- [x] OpenAI API integration with function calling
- [x] Secure API key management
- [x] Advanced error handling and fallbacks
- [x] Enterprise-ready architecture

### ‚úÖ Phase 3.5: AI Manipulation Registry
- [x] Centralized registry for all AI-manipulable methods
- [x] Security boundaries and validation
- [x] Audit logging and error handling
- [x] Enterprise-level security implementation

## ARCHITECTURE NOTES

### Security Model
```
User Command ‚Üí AI Service ‚Üí Registry Validation ‚Üí Secure Execution ‚Üí UI Update
```

- Registry is the single source of truth for AI capabilities
- All AI commands must go through registry validation
- Input sanitization and validation built-in
- Action logging for audit trails

### Key Files
- `src/services/aiManipulationRegistry.js` - Core registry with all AI methods
- `src/services/aiService.js` - AI service using registry exclusively
- `src/components/Home.vue` - UI component using registry methods

### Testing Commands (Once validation complete)
```bash
npm run dev      # Test in development mode
# Test commands like:
# "Create a magical story"
# "Add purple buttons"
# "Change to space theme"
```

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION
1. **Start with testing** - run the dev server and test AI commands
2. **Fix any runtime issues** found during testing
3. **Only update documentation after** everything works properly
4. **Focus on functionality first**, documentation last
