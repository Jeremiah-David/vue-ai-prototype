# Vue AI Prototype

A Vue 3 prototype application for testing AI-driven UI manipulation features. This app allows users to interact with predefined methods through AI commands to manipulate the UI (add buttons, counters, backgrounds, etc.).

## Project Overview

This is a simple Vue 3 application built with Vite that serves as a testing ground for AI-driven event management features. While the end goal is an events app where admins can create events by telling AI to set names, descriptions, dates, tickets, etc., this prototype focuses on basic UI manipulation through AI commands.

## Features

- Vue 3 with Composition API
- Vite for fast development and building
- AI-driven UI manipulation (coming soon)
- Simple, manipulable UI components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.19.0 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
